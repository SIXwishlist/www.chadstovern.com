  <p>When you see the word procrastination what do you think of?</p><ul><li>Laziness?</li><li>Poor work ethic?</li><li>Lack of care?</li></ul><p><img alt="OmniFocus Completed" src="/img/omnifocus-completed-small.png" /></p><p>Those things can be true — but let's face it — the fact that we're skimming an article like this this is a form of "care" and therefore a pretty good sign those things are mostly untrue of us.  What I believe happens more often than not is that our brain gets in the way.  I'll give you a quick example of something I've been neglecting lately, my expense report.</p><p>That seems like such an easy task.  It's a task that benefits me directly, with money!  Why on earth have I not finished my last expense report?  I've seen a reminder in my <em>trusted system</em> that tells me "do expense report today".  The issue is "do expense report today" — while seemingly actionable — is not.  My brain knows that there are more steps to that task that I haven't defined; It's actually a project.  Maybe I know I need to print off receipts, but I have no idea where I put them.  If I don't know what the next well defined physical action is to achieve the goal of a submitted expense report, my brain provides resistance to working on it.  Let's fix this.</p><p>The <em>project</em> "Complete Expense Report" has several physical action steps that might look like this:</p><ul><li>Find receipt from OfficeMax inbox purchase</li><li>Plot mileage from the office to our recent vendor meet-up</li><li>Find last months mileage email on my Mac to find current reimbursement rate</li><li>Calculate mileage owed and enter into expense report spreadsheet</li><li>Print cell phone receipt for on call reimbursement</li><li>Enter data for printed receipts into expense report spreadsheet</li><li>Print expense report spreadsheet</li><li>Attach receipts to expense report spreadsheet</li><li>Sign expense report and turn in to my boss</li></ul><p>That sounds really fancy and unnecessary Chad.  Oh really?  How many nagging things do you have on a list or floating in your head that you feel bad about because you haven't done anything about them yet?<br clear="none" /></p><p><strong>Here's my challenge to you:</strong> over the next week find one thing you've been putting off that you feel is important and figure out what the first or next <em>physical</em> action is that is required to get you closer to completion.  If you do this for even one item on your todo list that isn't getting done, I promise you'll make more progress than just ocassionally thinking about it or feeling bad that it isn't done yet.  In fact, it looks like I'm all set with a set of super simple yet very well defined tasks that will lead me to finally get my latest expense report finished.</p>

  <h2><a name="wow;_that_sounds_pretty_exciting_doesn’t_it?" shape="rect"></a>Wow; that sounds pretty exciting doesn’t it?</h2><p>If you do much shell scripting (I frequent bash) at some point you’ll come across “IFS” and learn to appreciate the usefulness in manipulating it.  Let’s look at a script showing that — and then dive into the details.</p><pre><code class="bash">#!/usr/bin/env bash

## test function
ifs_test()
{
	cd ~/tmp || exit 1
	for entry in `ls -lah`
	do
		echo $entry
	done
}

## let’s see how it behaves
ifs_test

## let’s modify IFS and run it again
oIFS=$IFS
IFS="
"
ifs_test

## let’s be anal and restore IFS explicitly
IFS=$oIFS

exit
</code></pre><h2><a name="so_what’s_happening_here_and_how_is_it_relevant?" shape="rect"></a>So what’s happening here and how is it relevant?</h2><p>A number of times I’ve had to write scripts to automate the processing of files, which can turn out to be any combination of renaming them, moving them around, or checking if they are valid based on some set of rules.  One thing that can often bite me is file names with unexpected spaces.  You may say, “but people know how to name the files correctly, there’s documentation for it even.”  I’m sure you’re right, but you’re not accounting for the fact that these people are human.  Humans make mistakes.  You can get clever and pass results through another Unix tool, but I prefer to avoid extra dependencies when the shell I’m working in can handle it cleanly and efficiently.</p><p>As an example look at the bash function <code>ifs_test</code> in our example.  It’s just a trivial for loop which echoes out the results of the <code>ls -lah</code> command.  The first time it is called this is the result we get:</p><pre><code class="sh">[chadhs@mac scratch]$ ./ifstest.sh

That was super ugly; how do we fix it?</h2><p>Before explaining that, let’s see how the output looks the second time the function <code>ifs_test</code> is called.</p><pre><code class="sh">drwxr-xr-x   4 chadhs  staff   136B Mar 24 19:36 .

</code></pre><h2><a name="ahh…_that’s_much_better." shape="rect"></a>Ahh… that’s much better.</h2><p>So to fully understand what is going on each time the function <code>ifs_test</code> is called we need to understand what the variable IFS is.  By default the internal shell variable IFS is set to recognize spaces, tabs, and new lines as a field delimiter (aka Internal Field Separator).  Seeing that there are multiple spaces in each of our results from the <code>ls -lah</code> command in the for loop, our shell is treating every single white space (compare the first result to the second) as a delimiter for a new item in our list of results renerated in the for loop.</p><h2><a name="now_for_the_fix" shape="rect"></a>Now for the fix</h2><p>You’ll notice in our example that before the function <code>ifs_test</code> is called the second time, we set a variable called oIFS to store the default value of IFS, and then change IFS to only treat a new line as a field separator / delimiter.  Once we no longer need this behavior we then set IFS back to it’s default value <a href="#fn-1" id="fnref1" shape="rect"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p><h2><a name="wrapping_it_all_up" shape="rect"></a>Wrapping it all up</h2><p>The reason I spent a little time writing this up and sharing it was the simple fact that learning about how to alter IFS to control how the shell delimits results saved me some pain in a project recently.  My scripts continued to run and do their job but I’d get a lot of little errors when someone didn’t follow the documentation; and trusting humans is just bad for business.  ;-)</p><ol><li id="fn-1">In theory we can just unset IFS to return it to it’s default value, but I like to do it manually & explicitly.<a href="#fnref1" shape="rect">↩</a></li></ol>
