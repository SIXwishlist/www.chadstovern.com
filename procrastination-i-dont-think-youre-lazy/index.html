  <p>When you see the word procrastination what do you think of?</p><ul><li>Laziness?</li><li>Poor work ethic?</li><li>Lack of care?</li></ul><p><img src="/img/omnifocus-completed-small.png" alt="OmniFocus Completed" /></p><p>Those things can be true — but let's face it — the fact that we're skimming an article like this this is a form of "care" and therefore a pretty good sign those things are mostly untrue of us.  What I believe happens more often than not is that our brain gets in the way.  I'll give you a quick example of something I've been neglecting lately, my expense report.</p><p>That seems like such an easy task.  It's a task that benefits me directly, with money!  Why on earth have I not finished my last expense report?  I've seen a reminder in my <em>trusted system</em> that tells me "do expense report today".  The issue is "do expense report today" — while seemingly actionable — is not.  My brain knows that there are more steps to that task that I haven't defined; It's actually a project.  Maybe I know I need to print off receipts, but I have no idea where I put them.  If I don't know what the next well defined physical action is to achieve the goal of a submitted expense report, my brain provides resistance to working on it.  Let's fix this.</p><p>The <em>project</em> "Complete Expense Report" has several physical action steps that might look like this:</p><ul><li>Find receipt from OfficeMax inbox purchase</li><li>Plot mileage from the office to our recent vendor meet-up</li><li>Find last months mileage email on my Mac to find current reimbursement rate</li><li>Calculate mileage owed and enter into expense report spreadsheet</li><li>Print cell phone receipt for on call reimbursement</li><li>Enter data for printed receipts into expense report spreadsheet</li><li>Print expense report spreadsheet</li><li>Attach receipts to expense report spreadsheet</li><li>Sign expense report and turn in to my boss</li></ul><p>That sounds really fancy and unnecessary Chad.  Oh really?  How many nagging things do you have on a list or floating in your head that you feel bad about because you haven't done anything about them yet?<br /></p><p><strong>Here's my challenge to you:</strong> over the next week find one thing you've been putting off that you feel is important and figure out what the first or next <em>physical</em> action is that is required to get you closer to completion.  If you do this for even one item on your todo list that isn't getting done, I promise you'll make more progress than just ocassionally thinking about it or feeling bad that it isn't done yet.  In fact, it looks like I'm all set with a set of super simple yet very well defined tasks that will lead me to finally get my latest expense report finished.</p>
