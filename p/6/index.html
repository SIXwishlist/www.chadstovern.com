  <p><img alt="Gmail" src="/img/gmail.png" /></p><p>I'll start this post by stating that I've been a Google fan for years.  I've been a Gmail user since I snagged a beta invite in college.  I followed the development of Android from before the time the G1 was announced.  I was labeled "another one of those annoying people that <em>have</em> to use Chrome" when it was still in early single digit releases. <a href="#fn-1" id="fnref1" shape="rect"><sup>1</sup></a>  Who would be the first to quote "Do no evil"?  — This guy.</p><p>I've decided that in many facets of my life online that I'm sick of being the product and not the customer.  I am not woo'd by Google or Facebook to stay with them because of feature X or enhancement Y — no no, that focus is for the real customers — advertisers. <a href="#fn-2" id="fnref2" shape="rect"><sup>2</sup></a>  There can be real conveniences to being served relevant ad data and the US federal government is pretty much scanning everything anyway.  However, I'm at a point now where I want to more actively and consciously decide what information I'm going to give organizations.  I just want to start being the customer for once and have a little bit of personal privacy.  In this case, I'm just not ok with any of my primary forms of communication being used to target ad data to me anymore.</p><h2><a name="fastmail_to_the_rescue?" shape="rect"></a>Fastmail to the rescue?</h2>I've looked at Opera's Fastmail offering before and have read some pretty glowing reviews about their service lately.  A couple short conversations over on App.net also sparked my interest to look into their service a bit further.  Unfortunately for my needs it's slightly cost prohibitive.  I want two email accounts each on their own domain.  A "proper" setup with Fastmail would cost me 80 USD per year.  I could utilize domain aliases and create some rules to bring it down to 40 USD, but I really want these accounts seperate and don't want to have to deal with the "reply–as" hassle with my mail applications.<p>After "reading the rags" (various forums), there have been a number of incidents where accounts were shut off for hitting send caps, or flagged and disabled for sending bulk mail out when it was not the fault of the user.  These sorts of reports — of which there were more than a few — were enough to give me pause to at least look at the rest of the competition.</p><h2><a name="polarismail_+_icloud_calendars" shape="rect"></a>PolarisMail + iCloud Calendars</h2>A number of people that were looking for options other than Fastmail were recommending a service called <a href="ttps://www.polarismail.com" shape="rect">PolarisMail</a>.  I'm always a bit leary of seemingly obscure recommendations.  In this case I was pleasantly surprised.  The reviews seemed to be all positive, the pricing competitive, and they even had a "Fastmail Promotion" running.  The promotion was designed for people unhappy with the Fastmail service and provided a 90 day free trial (up from 30) as well as a free basic mail account for every enhanced account purchased.  Their basic mail offering was only 12 USD per year per mailbox and supported multiple domains.  <p><strong>This means for 24 USD per year I could have the following.</strong></p><ul><li>Two mailboxes on seperate domains yet managed from a single admin panel</li><li>Fast IMAP & SMTP mail service</li><li>A choice of webmail interfaces including the very nice looking non–free (there is no additional cost; it's just not opensource) Atmail interface</li><li>25 GB of storage per mailbox</li></ul><p>I signed up for the 30 day free trial and emailed support about the Fastmail promotion.  <a href="#fn-3" id="fnref3" shape="rect"><sup>3</sup></a>  I mentioned that I was looking to move from Google Apps to Fastmail and stumbled upon PolarisMail.  I asked if they would be willing to apply the promotion to my account for choosing them over Fastmail.  It would not have by any means been a deal breaker, but in under an hour they had responded and bumped my free trial up to 90 days.  They did also let me know that since I purchased two basic accounts and no enhanced accounts that I would not be eligible for any free accounts.  No problems there, I was just happy to see the prompt communication!</p><p>As far as calendaring goes, I've decided to use iCloud to store and sync my calendars across my devices.  I use a Mac and iPad at work and at home and I'll be moving to an iPhone soon enough.  For Android users there is an app called "<a href="ttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dmfs.caldav.icloud&amp;hl=en" shape="rect">SmoothSync for Cloud Calendar</a>" on the Play Store that will let you access and sync your iCloud calendars.  Not much else to say here other than I've had zero issues with my calendaring so far.</p><h2><a name="polarismail_with_builtin_caldav_&amp;&amp;#95;carddav" shape="rect"></a>PolarisMail with builtin CalDav & CardDav</h2>If you don't want to be tied to Apple for your calendaring there are options for that too.  Apple supports connecting to any CalDav or CardDav service.  Fortunately PolarisMail offers "Enhanced" accounts for 24 USD per year that offer those services as well.  You can look at it simply as 12 USD per year for email hosting and 12 USD per year for calendar and contact hosting and syncing.<h2><a name="buyer&apos;s_remorse?" shape="rect"></a>Buyer's remorse?</h2><strong>Nope.</strong><p>I've been using the setup fo PolarisMail + iCloud calendars with my MacBook Pro, iPad, and Android phone for nearly two months now without a hiccup.</p><p>If I wanted to provide a tiny amount of critical feedback it would be that they still billed me after 30 days rather than a 90 day free trial.  They apologized and assured me that they would set the bill date forward for next year so I could get the extra two free months per my recommendation to keep things simple.</p><p>**If you're looking for an inexpensive reliable place to host your mail**, you should definitely consider taking <a href="ttps://www.polarismail.com" shape="rect">PolarisMail</a> for a spin.</p><ol><li id="fn-1">Now our whole dev team uses it as their primary browser.<a href="#fnref1" shape="rect">↩</a></li><li id="fn-2">Advertising isn't something I view as evil or wrong.  I merely resist it in the form of creepily parsing my personal data and building a profile to help decide which ads I see.  By contrast, I'm fine with seeing a giant Miller billboard at a Brewers game.  People that go to a stadium game are more likely to buy a beer or two, that makes sense.  Once again I would not be ok with them scanning my ticket when I purchase a brew so they could text me personalized coupon codes or something.<a href="#fnref2" shape="rect">↩</a></li><li id="fn-3">The Fastmail sales folks were friendly and helpful though it did often take more than a day between replies to my short thread with them asking questions about the service and migration options.<a href="#fnref3" shape="rect">↩</a></li></ol>

  <p>When you see the word procrastination what do you think of?</p><ul><li>Laziness?</li><li>Poor work ethic?</li><li>Lack of care?</li></ul><p><img alt="OmniFocus Completed" src="/img/omnifocus-completed-small.png" /></p><p>Those things can be true — but let's face it — the fact that we're skimming an article like this this is a form of "care" and therefore a pretty good sign those things are mostly untrue of us.  What I believe happens more often than not is that our brain gets in the way.  I'll give you a quick example of something I've been neglecting lately, my expense report.</p><p>That seems like such an easy task.  It's a task that benefits me directly, with money!  Why on earth have I not finished my last expense report?  I've seen a reminder in my <em>trusted system</em> that tells me "do expense report today".  The issue is "do expense report today" — while seemingly actionable — is not.  My brain knows that there are more steps to that task that I haven't defined; It's actually a project.  Maybe I know I need to print off receipts, but I have no idea where I put them.  If I don't know what the next well defined physical action is to achieve the goal of a submitted expense report, my brain provides resistance to working on it.  Let's fix this.</p><p>The <em>project</em> "Complete Expense Report" has several physical action steps that might look like this:</p><ul><li>Find receipt from OfficeMax inbox purchase</li><li>Plot mileage from the office to our recent vendor meet-up</li><li>Find last months mileage email on my Mac to find current reimbursement rate</li><li>Calculate mileage owed and enter into expense report spreadsheet</li><li>Print cell phone receipt for on call reimbursement</li><li>Enter data for printed receipts into expense report spreadsheet</li><li>Print expense report spreadsheet</li><li>Attach receipts to expense report spreadsheet</li><li>Sign expense report and turn in to my boss</li></ul><p>That sounds really fancy and unnecessary Chad.  Oh really?  How many nagging things do you have on a list or floating in your head that you feel bad about because you haven't done anything about them yet?<br clear="none" /></p><p><strong>Here's my challenge to you:</strong> over the next week find one thing you've been putting off that you feel is important and figure out what the first or next <em>physical</em> action is that is required to get you closer to completion.  If you do this for even one item on your todo list that isn't getting done, I promise you'll make more progress than just ocassionally thinking about it or feeling bad that it isn't done yet.  In fact, it looks like I'm all set with a set of super simple yet very well defined tasks that will lead me to finally get my latest expense report finished.</p>

  <h2><a name="wow;_that_sounds_pretty_exciting_doesn’t_it?" shape="rect"></a>Wow; that sounds pretty exciting doesn’t it?</h2><p>If you do much shell scripting (I frequent bash) at some point you’ll come across “IFS” and learn to appreciate the usefulness in manipulating it.  Let’s look at a script showing that — and then dive into the details.</p><pre><code class="bash">#!/usr/bin/env bash

## test function
ifs_test()
{
	cd ~/tmp || exit 1
	for entry in `ls -lah`
	do
		echo $entry
	done
}

## let’s see how it behaves
ifs_test

## let’s modify IFS and run it again
oIFS=$IFS
IFS="
"
ifs_test

## let’s be anal and restore IFS explicitly
IFS=$oIFS

exit
</code></pre><h2><a name="so_what’s_happening_here_and_how_is_it_relevant?" shape="rect"></a>So what’s happening here and how is it relevant?</h2><p>A number of times I’ve had to write scripts to automate the processing of files, which can turn out to be any combination of renaming them, moving them around, or checking if they are valid based on some set of rules.  One thing that can often bite me is file names with unexpected spaces.  You may say, “but people know how to name the files correctly, there’s documentation for it even.”  I’m sure you’re right, but you’re not accounting for the fact that these people are human.  Humans make mistakes.  You can get clever and pass results through another Unix tool, but I prefer to avoid extra dependencies when the shell I’m working in can handle it cleanly and efficiently.</p><p>As an example look at the bash function <code>ifs_test</code> in our example.  It’s just a trivial for loop which echoes out the results of the <code>ls -lah</code> command.  The first time it is called this is the result we get:</p><pre><code class="sh">[chadhs@mac scratch]$ ./ifstest.sh

That was super ugly; how do we fix it?</h2><p>Before explaining that, let’s see how the output looks the second time the function <code>ifs_test</code> is called.</p><pre><code class="sh">drwxr-xr-x   4 chadhs  staff   136B Mar 24 19:36 .

</code></pre><h2><a name="ahh…_that’s_much_better." shape="rect"></a>Ahh… that’s much better.</h2><p>So to fully understand what is going on each time the function <code>ifs_test</code> is called we need to understand what the variable IFS is.  By default the internal shell variable IFS is set to recognize spaces, tabs, and new lines as a field delimiter (aka Internal Field Separator).  Seeing that there are multiple spaces in each of our results from the <code>ls -lah</code> command in the for loop, our shell is treating every single white space (compare the first result to the second) as a delimiter for a new item in our list of results renerated in the for loop.</p><h2><a name="now_for_the_fix" shape="rect"></a>Now for the fix</h2><p>You’ll notice in our example that before the function <code>ifs_test</code> is called the second time, we set a variable called oIFS to store the default value of IFS, and then change IFS to only treat a new line as a field separator / delimiter.  Once we no longer need this behavior we then set IFS back to it’s default value <a href="#fn-1" id="fnref1" shape="rect"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p><h2><a name="wrapping_it_all_up" shape="rect"></a>Wrapping it all up</h2><p>The reason I spent a little time writing this up and sharing it was the simple fact that learning about how to alter IFS to control how the shell delimits results saved me some pain in a project recently.  My scripts continued to run and do their job but I’d get a lot of little errors when someone didn’t follow the documentation; and trusting humans is just bad for business.  ;-)</p><ol><li id="fn-1">In theory we can just unset IFS to return it to it’s default value, but I like to do it manually & explicitly.<a href="#fnref1" shape="rect">↩</a></li></ol>
