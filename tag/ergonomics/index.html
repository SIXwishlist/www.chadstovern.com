			<p>After nearly a decade of working jobs doing geek stuff sitting in front of a computer all day, I started developing lower back pain.  Even being active off hours wasn&#8217;t enough, so I caved and talked my boss into a <a href="http://www.geekdesk.com/geekdesk-v3">GeekDesk v3</a>.</p>
<p>However, now that I&#8217;ve moved on and am part of a small <a href="https://idonethis.com/about/our-team/">startup team</a> working from my home office, that&#8217;s just not a purchase I was ready to justify again.  Nine months into my new adventure with <a href="https://idonethis.com">iDoneThis</a> and my enthusiasm is high, yet my back is killing&nbsp;me…</p>
<p>Colin, the founder of <a href="http://customer.io">Customer.io</a>, has an awesome and famous post about his <a href="http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html">$22 standing desk</a>.  This is truly a creative gem, that I really wanted to set up for&nbsp;myself.</p>
<p>My problem was that my desk has a raised monitor area.  I would either have to remove part of the desk or hack off half of the back legs of the table in Colin&#8217;s solution.&nbsp;:-(</p>
<p><img alt="Desk Sitting" src="/images/desk-sitting.jpg" /></p>
<p>I thought about finding or building a couple simple boxes as the dimensions I would need for the monitor section of my desk and the work surface were roughly the&nbsp;same.  </p>
<p>After searching around for those dimensions I found this stackable <a href="http://www.target.com/p/room-essentials-24-horizontal-shelf-espresso/-/A-15091670">shelf unit</a> (11.63&#8221; H x 24.13&#8221; W x 11.63&#8221; D and holds up to 20 pounds) at Target.  The total cost with tax and shipping was only $19.84 ( due to a 10% off coupon code + free in store&nbsp;pickup).</p>
<p>Once I brought the shelves home, it took me all of 20 minutes to clear my desk, assemble them, and set my gear back up.  I&#8217;ve been standing for a week now and once again my back pain has&nbsp;subsided.</p>
