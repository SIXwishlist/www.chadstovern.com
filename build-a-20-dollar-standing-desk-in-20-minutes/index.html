  <p>After nearly a decade of working jobs doing geek stuff sitting in front of a computer all day, I started developing lower back pain.  Even being active off hours wasn't enough, so I caved and talked my boss into a <a href='http://www.geekdesk.com/geekdesk-v3'>GeekDesk v3</a>.</p><p>However, now that I've moved on and am part of a small <a href='https://idonethis.com/about/our-team/'>startup team</a> working from my home office, that's just not a purchase I was ready to justify again.  Nine months into my new adventure with <a href='https://idonethis.com'>iDoneThis</a> and my enthusiasm is high, yet my back is killing me…</p><p>Colin, the founder of <a href='http://customer.io'>Customer.io</a>, has an awesome and famous post about his <a href='http://iamnotaprogrammer.com/Ikea-Standing-desk-for-22-dollars.html'>$22 standing desk</a>.  This is truly a creative gem, that I really wanted to set up for myself.</p><p>My problem was that my desk has a raised monitor area.  I would either have to remove part of the desk or hack off half of the back legs of the table in Colin's solution.  :-(</p><p><img src="/img/desk-sitting.jpg" alt="Desk Sitting" /></p><p>I thought about finding or building a couple simple boxes as the dimensions I would need for the monitor section of my desk and the work surface were roughly the same.<br /></p><p>After searching around for those dimensions I found this stackable <a href='http://www.target.com/p/room-essentials-24-horizontal-shelf-espresso/-/A-15091670'>shelf unit</a> (11.63" H x 24.13" W x 11.63" D and holds up to 20 pounds) at Target.  The total cost with tax and shipping was only $19.84 ( due to a 10% off coupon code + free in store pickup).</p><p>Once I brought the shelves home, it took me all of 20 minutes to clear my desk, assemble them, and set my gear back up.  I've been standing for a week now and once again my back pain has subsided.</p><p><img src="/img/desk-standing.jpg" alt="Desk Standing" /></p>
