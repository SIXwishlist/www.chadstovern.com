<p>When you see the word procrastination what do you think&nbsp;of?</p>
<ul>
<li>Laziness?</li>
<li>Poor work&nbsp;ethic?</li>
<li>Lack of&nbsp;care?</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="OmniFocus Completed" src="/images/omnifocus-completed-small.png" /></p>
<p>Those things can be true — but let&#8217;s face it — the fact that we&#8217;re skimming an article like this this is a form of &#8220;care&#8221; and therefore a pretty good sign those things are mostly untrue of us.  What I believe happens more often than not is that our brain gets in the way.  I&#8217;ll give you a quick example of something I&#8217;ve been neglecting lately, my expense&nbsp;report.</p>
<p>That seems like such an easy task.  It&#8217;s a task that benefits me directly, with money!  Why on earth have I not finished my last expense report?  I&#8217;ve seen a reminder in my <em>trusted system</em> that tells me &#8220;do expense report today&#8221;.  The issue is &#8220;do expense report today&#8221; — while seemingly actionable — is not.  My brain knows that there are more steps to that task that I haven&#8217;t defined; It&#8217;s actually a project.  Maybe I know I need to print off receipts, but I have no idea where I put them.  If I don&#8217;t know what the next well defined physical action is to achieve the goal of a submitted expense report, my brain provides resistance to working on it.  Let&#8217;s fix&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>The <em>project</em> &#8220;Complete Expense Report&#8221; has several physical action steps that might look like&nbsp;this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find receipt from OfficeMax inbox&nbsp;purchase</li>
<li>Plot mileage from the office to our recent vendor&nbsp;meet-up</li>
<li>Find last months mileage email on my Mac to find current reimbursement&nbsp;rate</li>
<li>Calculate mileage owed and enter into expense report&nbsp;spreadsheet</li>
<li>Print cell phone receipt for on call&nbsp;reimbursement</li>
<li>Enter data for printed receipts into expense report&nbsp;spreadsheet</li>
<li>Print expense report&nbsp;spreadsheet</li>
<li>Attach receipts to expense report&nbsp;spreadsheet</li>
<li>Sign expense report and turn in to my&nbsp;boss</li>
</ul>
<p>That sounds really fancy and unnecessary Chad.  Oh really?  How many nagging things do you have on a list or floating in your head that you feel bad about because you haven&#8217;t done anything about them&nbsp;yet?  </p>
<p><strong>Here&#8217;s my challenge to you:</strong> over the next week find one thing you&#8217;ve been putting off that you feel is important and figure out what the first or next <em>physical</em> action is that is required to get you closer to completion.  If you do this for even one item on your todo list that isn&#8217;t getting done, I promise you&#8217;ll make more progress than just ocassionally thinking about it or feeling bad that it isn&#8217;t done yet.  In fact, it looks like I&#8217;m all set with a set of super simple yet very well defined tasks that will lead me to finally get my latest expense report&nbsp;finished.</p>
